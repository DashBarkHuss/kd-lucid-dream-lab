Make you're changes as mnimal as possible. We can always make more changes later. Make sure you do not make unncessary changes. Do not deleting extra logging. Do not delete comments unless they are incorrect. Do not delete code that is working. If you want to make more changes, make a note of it and keept track of what additional changes you want to make so you can confirm with me before making them.

Once your make your changes, ask you'r self:

1. Did I delete any logging?
2. Did I delete any comments?
3. Did I delete any code that is working?
4. Did I make any unnecessary changes?
5. Did I make any changes that are not related to the issue at hand?
6. Did I delete a TODO: in a comment?
