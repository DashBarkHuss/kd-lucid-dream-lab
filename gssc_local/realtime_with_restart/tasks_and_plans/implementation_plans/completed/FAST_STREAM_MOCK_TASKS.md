# Speed-Controlled Board Implementation Tasks

## Overview

Implementation plan for the Speed-Controlled Board that provides configurable playback speeds for testing and development. This implementation inherits from BoardManager to leverage existing functionality.

## Core Tasks

### 1. SpeedControlledBoardManager Class Implementation

- [x] Create base class structure with initialization
  - [x] CSV file loading
  - [x] Configurable speed multiplier
  - [x] Inherit from BoardManager
- [x] Implement streaming methods
  - [x] `start_stream()`
  - [x] `get_new_data()`
  - [x] `get_initial_data()`

### 2. Verification

- [x] Basic testing
  - [x] Verify data is streamed at correct speed
  - [x] Verify data format matches real board
  - [x] Test with main
  - [x] Run all tests
  - [x] Run regression test (run main.py)

### 3. Documentation

- [x] Add comprehensive documentation
  - [x] Add docstrings to all methods
  - [x] Document configuration options and parameters
  - [x] Add usage examples
  - [x] Update README.md with implementation details
  - [x] Add inline comments for complex logic
  - [x] Document speed multiplier behavior and limitations
  - [x] Document the main_mock_board_stream.py

## Next Steps

1. Consider renaming files to match new class name:
   - [x] Rename `mock_board_manager.py` to `speed_controlled_board_manager.py`
   - [x] Rename `main_mock_board_stream.py` to `main_speed_controlled_stream.py`
2. Test the current implementation with the main pipeline
3. Add any features we discover we need during testing
