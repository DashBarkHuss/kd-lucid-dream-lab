# Fast Stream Mock Implementation Tasks

## Overview

Implementation plan for the Fast Stream Mock that simulates real-time streaming with configurable speed. This implementation inherits from BoardManager to leverage existing functionality.

## Core Tasks

### 1. MockBoardManager Class Implementation

- [x] Create base class structure with initialization
  - [x] CSV file loading
  - [x] Configurable speed multiplier
  - [x] Inherit from BoardManager
- [x] Implement streaming methods
  - [x] `start_stream()`
  - [x] `get_new_data()`
  - [x] `get_initial_data()`

### 2. Verification

- [x] Basic testing
  - [x] Verify data is streamed at correct speed
  - [x] Verify data format matches real board
  - [x] Test with main pipeline

### 3. Documentation

- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
  - [ ] Add docstrings to all methods
  - [ ] Document configuration options and parameters
  - [ ] Add usage examples
  - [ ] Update README.md with mock implementation details
  - [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
  - [ ] Document speed multiplier behavior and limitations
  - [ ] Document the main_mock_board_stream.py

## Next Steps

1. Test the current implementation with the main pipeline
2. Add any features we discover we need during testing
