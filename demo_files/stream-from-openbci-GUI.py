# Summary: This script connects to an OpenBCI Ganglion board via network streaming,
# receives EEG data, and visualizes it as a horizontal graph in the terminal.
# It uses BrainFlow to handle the data stream from the OpenBCI GUI, displaying
# real-time brain activity as a moving dot indicator.

# To connect the OpenBCI GUI to the computer running this script
# 1. System Control Panel -> Ganglion Live
# 2. Select the following settings:
# - Pick Transfer Protocol: BLED112 Dongle
# - BLE Device: select your ganglion board
# - Session Data: BDF+
# - Brainflow Streamer: Network, ip address to 225.1.1.1, port to 6677
# 3. Start Session 
# 4. Start Data Stream
# 5. Remove the filters if you want it to match the logs in this script
# - Filters -> Click "All" to turn the channel icons black which means no filters are applied

# In the terminal you'll see the samples ploted out in a vertical stream.
